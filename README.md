| **Golden Apple** | Pause growth   | Stops the Happy Ghast from naturally growing.                                                                                                                          |
| **Sugar**        | Unpause growth | Used when the Happy Ghast's growth is paused; resumes normal growth.                                                                                                   |
| **Bone**         | Revert growth  | Reverts 60 seconds of growth; only works if not paused.                                                                                                                  |
| **Snowball**     | Interact       | If growth is paused, displays a message that interaction is not possible. Otherwise, triggers the entity's default interaction behavior.                               |
| **Saddle**       | Equip and ride | Can only be equipped on baby Happy Ghasts for riding; adult Happy Ghasts cannot be directly saddled. After becoming an adult, the saddle will automatically disappear. |

## Interaction

- **Stealth (default: Shift) + Interact**: Using the sneak key while interacting with a Happy Ghast allows it to stay in place, even if its AI would normally move it around.
