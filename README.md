| **Snowball**     | Interact       | If growth is paused, displays a message that interaction is not possible. Otherwise, triggers the entity's default interaction behavior.                               |
| **Saddle**       | Equip and ride | Can only be equipped on baby Happy Ghasts for riding; adult Happy Ghasts cannot be directly saddled. After becoming an adult, the saddle will automatically disappear. |
